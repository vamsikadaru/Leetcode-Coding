/*
To determine if there are two integers aa and bb such that a2+b2=ca2+b2=c, we can use a two-pointer technique. This approach involves iterating over possible values for aa and bb to check if their squares sum up to cc.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step approach:

    1. Initialize two pointers: one starting from a=0 and the other from b=sqrt(c)
    2. Use a while loop to adjust a and b based on the comparison of a2+b2 with c.
    3. If a2+b2=c, return true.
    4. If a2+b2<c, increment a to increase the sum.
    5, If a2+b2>c, decrement b to decrease the sum.
    6. If the two pointers cross each other, return false as no such pair (a,b)(a,b) was found.
